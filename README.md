Use this code as an exemple of A* algorithm for solving 15 game!

You can solve random generated desks or prepare your own desk variants. 

If you want to solve your's varians of desc - use debug method in solver.cpp:
You must enebled "debug" macros in solver.cpp and put numbers in correct order to fill desc array.

If you want to find solution for random generated desc - disable "debug" macros in solver.cpp
